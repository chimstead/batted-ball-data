# batted-ball-data

To run the application: head to https://chimstead.shinyapps.io/BattedBallData/

This project was created with a 5 hour time limit to best analyze a dataset of all MLB batted balls from April 1st to April 9th. Because of the size of the dataset, player-level or team-level analysis was not statistically reasonable, so I created insights based around the relationship between batted ball statistics and play outcome.
